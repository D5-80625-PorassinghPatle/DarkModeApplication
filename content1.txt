There are a lot of advantages to using dark mode, like extended battery life and reduced glare and blue light exposure.

MORE BATTERY, LESS CHARGING: Using dark mode can extend your battery life by up to 30%, which means you won’t need to charge your phone as often.

Note: If you find it’s harder to read in dark mode, dimming the brightness on regular mode also will extend your battery life.

Science has shown that blue-turquoise light can impact sleep/wake cycles, meaning it can be difficult to get sufficient rest if you’re exposed to enough blue-turquoise light close to bedtime. It's important to note, however, that blue-light glasses typically filter blue-violet light (400-455 nm), not blue-turquoise light (465-495 nm), which is what impacts sleep/wake cycles.

REDUCE BLUE LIGHT EXPOSURE: Switching your phone to dark mode can help reduce blue light exposure.

Many phones also have a blue light filter. The filter, which should also be located in display settings, lets you adjust the amount of blue light emitted from your screen. This is a great option for those who can’t see well in dark mode.

AVOID SCREEN GLARE: If you’re viewing your screen in a dark room, the bright light from default display settings can cause an irritating glare — an uncomfortable level of contrast between the screen and your surroundings. Using dark mode will cut the glare from your screen significantly for comfortable viewing.

You also can dim your screen manually in light mode or set your brightness to adjust automatically based on the surrounding lighting. Either option will effectively reduce glare if you prefer not to use dark mode.
